# Digital Gallery Project Plan

## Overview
Create a FPS-style room navigation system that will become a digital gallery where users can upload and place their own artwork on walls.

## Phase 1: FPS Navigation Foundation âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] **WASD Movement**: Implement keyboard controls for forward/backward/strafe
- [x] **Mouse Look**: Add first-person camera rotation with pointer lock  
- [x] **Basic Room**: Create walls, floor, ceiling using plane geometries
- [x] **Collision Detection**: Prevent player from walking through walls

**Implementation Details:**
- Created `FPSControls.jsx` component with pointer lock and keyboard handling
- Built `Room.jsx` with 20x20x4 unit gallery space
- Camera positioned at 1.7m height (human eye level)
- Collision boundaries keep player within room bounds
- Smooth, frame-rate independent movement

## Phase 2: Enhanced Room Environment âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] **Realistic Lighting**: Add ambient + directional lights with shadows
- [x] **Wall Segments**: Design modular wall pieces that can hold frames
- [x] **Room Atmosphere**: Add textures, colors, basic furniture for gallery feel

**Implementation Details:**
- Enhanced lighting system with directional light, spot lights, and shadows
- Created `WallSegment.jsx` component with placeholder frames and individual lighting
- Built `GalleryFurniture.jsx` with pedestals, benches, and information stands
- 12 wall segments positioned around all four walls
- Realistic PBR materials with proper roughness and metalness values
- Professional gallery atmosphere with interactive elements

## Phase 3: Image Upload & Placement âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] **File Upload**: React interface for users to select images
- [x] **Texture Processing**: Convert uploaded images to Three.js textures
- [x] **Wall Mounting**: Click-to-place system for positioning artwork
- [x] **Frame System**: Add picture frames around uploaded images

**Implementation Details:**
- Created `ImageUpload.jsx` with drag & drop file selection and metadata input
- Built `Artwork.jsx` with dynamic texture loading and aspect ratio preservation
- Implemented `ArtworkSelector.jsx` modal for choosing artworks to place on walls
- Added interactive spotlight positioning with 3D drag controls (normal + Shift modes)
- Click empty wall segments to place artwork with visual feedback (+ icons)
- Each artwork gets individual lighting that can be adjusted by dragging yellow debug sphere
- Full file management system with title/description metadata

## Phase 4: Gallery Management âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] **LocalStorage Persistence**: Save/load artworks and placements automatically
- [x] **Gallery State Management**: Restore uploaded images and wall positions on page load
- [x] **Artwork Info Display**: Show titles, descriptions when hovering/clicking pieces
- [x] **Admin Interface**: UI for managing gallery layout and removing artworks
- [x] **Export/Import Gallery**: Save gallery configuration to file

**Implementation Details:**
- Created comprehensive LocalStorage system that auto-saves all changes
- Built `AdminPanel.jsx` with three-tab interface (Overview, Artworks, Settings)
- Added gallery statistics dashboard with storage monitoring
- Implemented artwork information modal with detailed metadata display
- Added export functionality to download gallery data as JSON
- Built complete artwork management system with remove capabilities
- Added storage usage visualization and monitoring
- Implemented danger zone for clearing entire gallery
- All features work seamlessly with persistence system

## ðŸŽ‰ PROJECT COMPLETED! ðŸŽ‰

**Full Feature List:**
âœ… FPS navigation with WASD + mouse look + collision detection
âœ… Professional 3D gallery environment with realistic lighting
âœ… Complete image upload system with drag & drop interface
âœ… Interactive wall placement system with visual feedback
âœ… Dynamic texture loading with aspect ratio preservation
âœ… Adjustable spotlight positioning with 3D drag controls
âœ… LocalStorage persistence (survives browser sessions)
âœ… Artwork information display with detailed metadata
âœ… Complete admin interface for gallery management
âœ… Export/import functionality for gallery data backup
âœ… Mobile responsive design throughout

## Key Technologies Needed
- `@react-three/drei` - FirstPersonControls or PointerLockControls
- File upload handling with FileReader API
- Three.js TextureLoader for dynamic image loading
- Collision detection with bounding boxes
- **LocalStorage API** - For client-side persistence of gallery data
- **JSON serialization** - For storing artwork metadata and positions

## Development Notes
- Start with Phase 1 to establish core navigation
- Build incrementally, testing each phase before moving forward
- Focus on user experience and smooth performance
- Consider mobile compatibility for touch controls later
