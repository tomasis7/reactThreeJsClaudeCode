# Digital Gallery Project Plan

## Overview
Create a FPS-style room navigation system that will become a digital gallery where users can upload and place their own artwork on walls.

## Phase 1: FPS Navigation Foundation ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **WASD Movement**: Implement keyboard controls for forward/backward/strafe
- [x] **Mouse Look**: Add first-person camera rotation with pointer lock  
- [x] **Basic Room**: Create walls, floor, ceiling using plane geometries
- [x] **Collision Detection**: Prevent player from walking through walls

**Implementation Details:**
- Created `FPSControls.jsx` component with pointer lock and keyboard handling
- Built `Room.jsx` with 20x20x4 unit gallery space
- Camera positioned at 1.7m height (human eye level)
- Collision boundaries keep player within room bounds
- Smooth, frame-rate independent movement

## Phase 2: Enhanced Room Environment ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **Realistic Lighting**: Add ambient + directional lights with shadows
- [x] **Wall Segments**: Design modular wall pieces that can hold frames
- [x] **Room Atmosphere**: Add textures, colors, basic furniture for gallery feel

**Implementation Details:**
- Enhanced lighting system with directional light, spot lights, and shadows
- Created `WallSegment.jsx` component with placeholder frames and individual lighting
- Built `GalleryFurniture.jsx` with pedestals, benches, and information stands
- 12 wall segments positioned around all four walls
- Realistic PBR materials with proper roughness and metalness values
- Professional gallery atmosphere with interactive elements

## Phase 3: Image Upload & Placement
- [ ] **File Upload**: React interface for users to select images
- [ ] **Texture Processing**: Convert uploaded images to Three.js textures
- [ ] **Wall Mounting**: Click-to-place system for positioning artwork
- [ ] **Frame System**: Add picture frames around uploaded images

## Phase 4: Gallery Management
- [ ] **Admin Interface**: UI for managing gallery layout and artworks
- [ ] **Artwork Info**: Display titles, descriptions when viewing pieces
- [ ] **Persistence**: Save/load gallery configurations

## Key Technologies Needed
- `@react-three/drei` - FirstPersonControls or PointerLockControls
- File upload handling with FileReader API
- Three.js TextureLoader for dynamic image loading
- Collision detection with bounding boxes
- Local storage or backend for persistence

## Development Notes
- Start with Phase 1 to establish core navigation
- Build incrementally, testing each phase before moving forward
- Focus on user experience and smooth performance
- Consider mobile compatibility for touch controls later
